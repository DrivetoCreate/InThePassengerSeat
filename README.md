# In the Passenger Seat

The website for "In the Passenger Seat", a Drive to Create Podcast.

---

## Setup
This site uses [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). If you do not already have them installed, open up a terminal and install both Ruby gems by typing (Macs are good to go. If you're on a Windows machine, you may need to install Ruby first):

`sudo gem install sass` (You may be asked to enter your password)

`sudo gem install compass`

Once both are installed, navigate to the project directory and run `compass watch`. Whenever you update a .scss file, it will automatically re-compile the .css file. To stop, `Control+C` to Cancel.
